Leadership / Adaptive Leadership,AL004,Learning through Self-Correction,"Adaptive leaders encourage experimentation, reflection, and self-correction. Even if an experiment fails, something valuable can be learned from it. That’s why it’s important for everyone to have the opportunity to reflect on an experiment’s failure or success. Reflection may lead to the realization that a correction is needed. You may not only need to correct a course of action – you may also need to self-correct.

The most effective adaptive leaders are always in a state of self-reflection. They run experiments to see what works. You’ll need to continually assess what’s happening in your organization so you can take corrective midcourse action if necessary. While focused on a course of action, you may fall into common traps if you don’t understand yourself well enough to self-correct.

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to:

• Recognize the need for reflection, self-correction, and experimentation
